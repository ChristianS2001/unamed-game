# Game Idea's / Plan

## General Ideas

- Semi open world, similar to pokemon legends of arcues, where there are regions that you load in
- Each region will be different in difficulty but also based on shows like Frieren and Jobless reincarnation
- The final boss twist will be that you have to fight yourself as a different class and it will mirror what you do since at some point you will be declared the strongest
- There will be a water region and you will have to sail
- You will have supporting characters as you play single player but you can do up to 3 player co-op and someone else can take over a supporting player to become another main player, this will mean we will have to adjust the difficulty
- There will be dungeons
- A flying region similar to the mechanics of moonstone island would be cool
- The magic will be elemental based but color graded, meaning the element is the base power but the color of the magic is what determines the stregnth
- The basic elements will be fire, electric, water, earth
- Each element will have a type of spell to heal, damage, buff the player or others, and block yourself off from enemies
- Rare magic: Time (age an enemy to death), dark (megumi's doman type shit), curse (a type of magic with crazy cool downs but damages overtime/disables enemies abilities), light (decently strong magic but is very fast, also can make the player move quicker)
- Look into making it so all basic elements provide a movement of sorts, where rare elements provide a cooler and more useful movement
- The 3 available classes are Mage, Cleric, Blessed Knight
    - All of these classes are to be considered special in the world, nothing usual. Meaning a cleric is a special magic using doctor that doesn't happen much, blessed knight is the same but a knight using magic, and a mage is a rare thing as well.
- Magic is a new thing for the common public and has always been reserved for people that represent the religion everyone follows
- When playing by yourself the other groupmates in your team basically just help block/buff the main player/or throw an attack or two 

## Lore
- There is a religion that rules the land, this religion is made up of two gods that have two demi gods, one good one bad, these are the main drivers in the plot
- You live in a castle kingdom that follows this religion, it is a religion where no one besides the king has met anyone of signifigance, the king met the bad demigod posing as the good one.
- The king is slaughtered right before the main characters eyes but at the last second before the bad demi god goes to kill you, the good demi god bestows you with great power
- You then get teleported away into someones farm, and this farm becomes your new home.
- You work here to get by but also practice magic by using it to protect the farm. You discover your weapon of choice via accidently opening a magic pocket dimension of sorts to claim your weapon and put it back when you need
